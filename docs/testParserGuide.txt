This test read every file in the folder ltsa/dist/examples/ParserTest and run them from the MTSA parser tool. 
When you need to test the parser with some particular grammar, please write your LTS having the next considerations.

The test always compile the label named "TEST" so just write something like:
|| TEST = ....
in the composition you want to test.

If you need to test more than one label per file, write in the folder so many files as labels you wish to test but changing the label to be tested.

If you have something like,

|| A = ....
|| B = ....


write 2 files:

|| TEST = ...
|| B = ....

and

|| A = ....
|| TEST = ...

Once you writed the suitable files, just run the test by running MTSATest/src/parser/parserStressTest.java as a JUnit Test.
